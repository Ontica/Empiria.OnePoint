# Empiria OnePoint Regulation

[Empiria OnePoint](http://www.ontica.org/) Regulation is our technology solution for regulatory, supervisory and oversight authorities and agencies.

As other Empiria products, this backend runs over [Empiria Framework](https://github.com/Ontica/Empiria.Core)
components and, as usual, needs some of the [Empiria Extensions](https://github.com/Ontica/Empiria.Extensions).

Also, it depends on many of the components of [Empiria Steps](https://github.com/Ontica/Empiria.Steps), our process and project
management solution, and is part of [Empiria OnePoint](https://github.com/Ontica/Empiria.OnePoint), our suite of software
components that allow governments to provide services to people and organizations using a single point of contact.

This solution is based on C# 8.0 and .NET Framework 4.8 and projects can be compiled using
Visual Studio 2022 Community Edition.
