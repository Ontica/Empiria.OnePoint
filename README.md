[Empiria OnePoint](http://www.ontica.org/) is a suite of software components that allow governments
to provide services to people and organizations using a single point of contact.

This repository contains the system's domain components, application services (uses cases),
a web API interface to interact with the backend, and connectors to hook other systems and components
to Empiria OnePoint.

This project is based on C# and .NET Framework and can be compiled using Visual Studio 2022 Community Edition.

As other Empiria products, this backend runs over [Empiria Framework](https://github.com/Ontica/Empiria.Core)
components and, as usual, needs some of the [Empiria Extensions](https://github.com/Ontica/Empiria.Extensions).
